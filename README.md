# Setting up Python

This page describes how to set up computing environments on the FHCC cluster, particularly focused on python.
We use micromamba, see manual here: "https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html", which is a lightweight package manager that is employed in a similar fashion as conda.

To install micromamba, use the following command: ```"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)```
